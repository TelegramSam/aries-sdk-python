# indy-sdk-python

This is the library that allows use of aries-sdk with python.

## Contributions

All contributions welcome.

## Pre-requiste

This library relies on [indy-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk#installing-the-sdk), but this
will be changed to aries-sdk as soon as the sdk split occurs. The interfaces
present in this library should remain the same during that transition.
